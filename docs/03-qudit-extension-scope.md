## Executive summary

Extending `qcode-discovery` from qubit (F₂) to qudit (GF(q)) is **feasible and
front-loaded.** The construction layer is the entry point and the **CSS path is
nearly free**, because qldpc's `BBCode` is field-generic and auto-inserts the
antipode + sign (`matrix_z = [Bᵀ, −Aᵀ]`) needed for odd-`q` CSS commutativity —
confirmed live that `BBCode(field=3)` yields `[[72,8]]` with
`is_subsystem_code=False` and zero symplectic residual.

The single most **pervasive** edit is the genotype change from coefficient-free
`(x_exp, y_exp)` tuples to coefficient-carrying `(x_exp, y_exp, coeff)` triples —
small at each site but load-bearing and touching ~6 clusters. The **real work**
is the distance layer: the CSS BP-OSD bound breaks indirectly (hardcoded
`bp_method` kwargs reach `GUFDecoder` over GF(q) → `TypeError`; fix by gating on
`field.order == 2`), and the **prime-q mod-q MILP is the trustworthy distance
signal and the true critical path** (~2–3 days hardened).

**MVP = prime q (start q=3), CSS arm only, evolving + MILP/exact-verifying at
least one new qudit code.** The full pipeline (non-CSS PBB, prime-power, qudit
Clifford/LC equivalence) is research-grade and reasonably deferred. A believable
cross-concern MVP is **~1.5–2.5 weeks**, not the ~1 week implied by summing
per-concern minimums.

## Math framing: qudit BB = the GF(q) case of 2BGA / GB codes

Qudit bivariate bicycle (BB) codes are the abelian-cyclic special case of
**two-block group-algebra (2BGA)** codes over the group algebra `F_q[G]` with
`G = Z_ℓ × Z_m`, i.e. the ring `R = F_q[x,y]/(x^ℓ−1, y^m−1)`. Grounded in
Lin & Pryadko, *Quantum two-block group algebra codes* (arXiv:2306.16400, Phys.
Rev. A 109, 022407), and the qudit twisted-torus BB construction
(arXiv:2602.04443).

**Field requirement — prime-power `q` only (for the *direct* construction).**
`q = pᵐ` must be a **prime power** so that GF(q) is a field (both qldpc and
`galois` require this). **Composite-`d` (the ring `Z_d`, `d` not a prime power —
e.g. 6, 10, 12) is a distinct modular-qudit family that qldpc cannot reach
directly.** It is, however, **in scope via CRT factoring** — see
[05](05-arbitrary-dimension-crt.md): every `Z_d` check-matrix code factors exactly
into its prime-power reductions, so **square-free `d` (6, 10, 15, …) reduces to
prime fields** and is covered by the prime-`q` machinery plus a thin CRT layer;
**prime-power factors `Z_{p^a}` (a>1)** need either the `GF(p^a)` field path or a
`Z_{p^a}` ring backend (the open decision in [05](05-arbitrary-dimension-crt.md)).

**CSS stabilizer form (verified).** For circulants `A = L(a)`, `B = R(b)` from
`a, b ∈ R`:
- `H_X = (A, B)`
- `H_Z = (Bᵀ, −Aᵀ)` — equivalently `(b̂, −â)` where `^` is the **antipode**
  `g → g⁻¹` (`x → x⁻¹`, `y → y⁻¹`). Lin–Pryadko Eq. (41): `L(a)ᵀ = L(â)`, so the
  transpose of a circulant *is* the antipode; Eq. (16): the minus sign sits on
  the second block.

Load-bearing facts verified live on GF(3) `[[72,8]]`:
- The **relative opposite sign** between the two Z-blocks (plus antipode on both)
  is essential; a global sign is convention. Over F₂, `−1 = +1`, so it collapses
  to `(Bᵀ, Aᵀ)` — the minus is invisible only in characteristic 2.
- qldpc **auto-inserts this** on the CSS/`BBCode` path (`matrix_z` carries
  `2 = −1 mod 3` on half its nonzero entries). **No hand-derived sign needed.**
- For the hand-rolled **PBB symplectic**, `[Bᵀ | −Aᵀ] % q` (and `[−Bᵀ | Aᵀ] % q`)
  both give `k=8`, `is_subsystem_code=False`, zero residual; the current
  `[Bᵀ | Aᵀ]` (naive GF(2)) gives a wrong `k=36` subsystem code. **One-line fix.**

**Genotype must carry GF(q) coefficients.** 2BGA elements live in `F_q[G]` with
coefficients in `F_q`, not just `{0,1}`. A term is `c · x^a · y^b` with
`c ∈ GF(q)*`. Coefficients are load-bearing: over GF(3), `x³+y+y²` gives `k=8`,
but flipping a **single** monomial coefficient (`x³+2y+y²`) drives `k → 0`.
(Scaling the **whole** polynomial by a unit preserves `k` — a distinction an
implementer must respect when writing tests.)

**Commutativity / dimension over GF(q).** Abelian `G ⇒ L(a)=R(a) ⇒` commutativity
is automatic (Lin–Pryadko Sec. IV.2). Field-aware `k = n − rank_q(H_X) −
rank_q(H_Z)` is exactly `code.dimension` (verified `72−32−32=8`).

**Prime vs prime-power arithmetic (a correctness landmine, not a knob).** For
`q = pᵐ` you must use field arithmetic, **never integer `% q`**: in GF(4),
`2·3 = 1` and `3+3 = 0` in-field but `2` by integer mod — any residual `% q` on a
`galois.FieldArray` silently corrupts arithmetic without crashing. For **prime
`q` (2,3,5,7), integer mod-p coincides with field arithmetic**, which is why
prime `q` is the safe MVP.

## Distance / decoder strategy over GF(q)

The distance layer breaks in two distinct ways and needs a field-and-structure
dispatcher. The four backends:

**(A) CSS BP-OSD bound (`distance.py`) — indirect break, easy fix.** Hardcoded
`bp_method='product_sum'` reaches `GUFDecoder` over GF(q) and raises `TypeError`.
Gate the kwargs on `code.field.order == 2`; for `q>2` call the **kwarg-free** CSS
GUF bound. ~10 lines, verified working.

**(B) GUF per-sector bound — cheap pre-filter only.** Fast (~0.1 s, mild
`q`-scaling to q=7) but **loose by ~3×** (returns 18 vs true ≈6 on GF(3)
`[[72,8]]`). Since `FOM = k·d²/n`, a 3×-loose `d` inflates FOM ~9×. **Never pass
`max_weight` for q>2** (exponential null-vector enumeration). Use only as a screen;
require MILP/exact corroboration before trusting/saving.

**(C) Prime-q mod-q MILP (`distance_milp.py`) — the trustworthy signal, true
critical path.** Two validated deltas over scipy/HiGHS (no new solver):
1. replace the `−2` commutation/anticommutation slack with `−q`
   (`check·x − q·s == 0`);
2. replace the binary-OR weight indicator with a **big-M indicator**: q-ary vars
   `ub = q−1`, binary `w_j`, constraint `(q−1)·w_j − x_j ≥ 0` (and `≥ z_j` for
   symplectic), minimize `Σ w_j`.

Use the **signed** symplectic form `s_x·z − s_z·x mod q` (sign matters for q>2).
Anticommutation `≠ 0 mod q` is **not** one linear constraint: either loop the ILP
once per residue `r ∈ {1..q−1}` (q−1 exact solves) or add a big-M indicator
(1 looser-presolve solve). **Hard guard: assert q is prime** — the integer-slack
encoding is mathematically **invalid for GF(pᵐ)**.

**(D) Exact enumeration (`get_distance_exact`).** Field-generic but ~`q^k`
(brute-forces over GF(q)). Gate to tiny `(q,n,k)`; **replace SIGALRM with an
OS-level subprocess timeout** (in-process `signal.alarm` around qldpc C calls
crashes the interpreter, exit 144).

**MVP distance recipe (CSS, prime q):** GUF kwarg-free per-sector bound as a cheap
pre-filter → prime-q CSS mod-q MILP as the trusted ranking/save signal → `q^k`-gated
exact (OS timeout) for top candidates. **Keep a corroboration trust gate** (require
MILP confirmation before saving) rather than blindly disabling the `d/√n` filter —
the loose GUF bound with no guard is the single most under-rated risk.

**Non-CSS distance (deferred):** no cheap field-generic non-CSS decoder bound
exists (`QuditCode` lacks `with_decoder`; `get_distance_bound` is ~15 s/code and
loose). The only trustworthy non-CSS prime-q distance is the symplectic MILP
(research-grade). The full `distance_bposd_noncss.py` rewrite is the long pole.

---

## Top risks and mitigations

- **Loose GUF bound with no trust gate (the true under-rated risk).** ~3× loose ⇒
  FOM inflated ~9×; combined with disabling the `d/√n` filter, the search chases
  phantom-high FOMs. → GUF as pre-filter only; require MILP corroboration before
  any FOM is trusted/saved.
- **Prime vs prime-power MILP invalidity (correctness landmine).** Integer-slack
  mod-q MILP is invalid for GF(pᵐ). → hard `assert q prime` in the MILP path;
  route prime powers to GUF + exact only.
- **Prime-power galois-vs-integer pitfall everywhere.** Raw `% q` on a
  `FieldArray` over GF(pᵐ) silently corrupts. → centralize all field arithmetic
  in `field_utils`; for MVP stay on prime q.
- **Coefficient-blind canonicalization (silent merges).** `_milp_cache_key`,
  `_code_key`, openevolve dedup keys, `_classify_pattern`, and the `A==B⇒d=2`
  gate canonicalize on exponents only → over GF(q) distinct codes collide,
  collapsing MAP-Elites diversity. → one `genotype.canonicalize` helper including
  coeff; gate the `d=2` shortcut on q==2 (the `A=B⇒d=2` theorem is GF(2)-specific).
- **API-name errors (would crash before the field issue).**
  `get_distance_bound_with_decoder` is CSS-only; non-CSS distance uses the
  symplectic MILP; logicals via kwarg-free `get_logical_ops()`.
- **SIGALRM crashes the interpreter (exit 144).** → OS-level subprocess timeouts
  for all q>2 exact/bound calls.
- **Seed/baseline mismatch starving the cascade.** GF(2) `KNOWN_CODES` (n,k,d)
  differ over GF(q) (the gross-code analogue is `k=8`, not 12, over GF(3)); the
  `_safety_net_codes` `k>0` guarantee may not hold. → re-verify the safety net and
  recompute baselines on the target q *before* launching.
- **Effort optimism.** A believable cross-concern MVP is ~1.5–2.5 weeks; the
  prime-q MILP is the ~2–3 day critical path. → plan to the realistic estimate;
  gate scope to CSS prime-q first.

## Open questions (need a decision before/early in implementation)

1. **FOM normalization across fields:** keep `FOM = k·d²/n`, or weight by
   `log₂(q)` so a GF(q) code's `k` logical qudits count as `k·log₂(q)`
   logical-qubit-equivalents? Propagates to both evaluators, `results.py` Pareto,
   prompts, baselines, trust/early-stop thresholds. **Product call before Phase 4.**
2. **Coefficient search-space sizing:** open the full GF(q)* coefficient axis
   immediately, or de-risk with a coeff=1-only intermediate milestone first?
3. **MILP anticommutation encoding:** residue-loop (q−1 exact solves) vs big-M
   indicator (1 solve)? Benchmark at q=3,5 to pick the default.
4. **q fixed per campaign vs q in the genotype/MAP-Elites feature space?** Affects
   whether q lives in env or in each candidate.
5. **Genotype coefficient type:** `int ∈ 1..q−1` (prime q only) vs a true galois
   field element (required for GF(pᵐ))? Decide now to avoid a second migration.
6. **Which qudit best-known BB/PBB codes seed the prompts and references?**
   arXiv:2606.02418, Lin–Pryadko (2306.16400), and a GF(q) baseline sweep must
   supply verified `[[n,k,d]]_q` tuples before prompts can be authored truthfully.
7. **Stage-1 lattice viability is field-dependent** (rank determines k): a one-time
   GF(q) sweep is needed to rebuild `STAGE*_LATTICES` (current exclusions are GF(2)
   artifacts).
8. **Is qldpc's kwarg-free non-CSS `get_logical_ops()` trustworthy for all PBB
   codes over GF(q)**, or is a galois-ported fallback still needed?
9. **Target equivalence relation for dedup:** bare permutation, permutation +
   per-qudit GF(q)* scaling, or full local-Clifford? Decides whether the research
   `qudit_clifford` module is on the critical path for the publication headline.
10. **Scope confirmation:** ~~is composite-`d` out for v1?~~ **Resolved
    (2026-06-14): target arbitrary integer `d` via CRT factoring**
    ([05](05-arbitrary-dimension-crt.md)). Prime-power dimensions get **both**
    backends, ordered cheapest-first: **Phase 7a** Galois-qudit `GF(p^a)` (field),
    then **Phase 7b** modular-qudit `Z_{p^a}` (physical, SNF ring backend).
    No open dimension decisions remain.
